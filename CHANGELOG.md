# Changes

## 2.0.0 [xxxx/xx/xx]

**New Features:**

- Added the `azure-timeline` command to create a DFIR timeline for Azure logs. (#109) (@fukusuket)
- New `aws-ct-search` command to search through CloudTrail logs. (#117) (@fukusuket)
- Added support for an ignore-list file (`config/aws_ignore_rule_list.txt`) to skip loading rules by UUID, so superseded/duplicate rules can stay in the repo without being loaded. (#136) (@YamatoSecurity)

**Enhancements:**

- Reworked `-t, --output-type` for `aws-ct-timeline` and `azure-timeline` to take format **names** instead of numbers, and added **DuckDB** output. Pass `csv`, `json`, `jsonl`, and/or `duckdb` (comma-separated or repeated) to write any combination at once, e.g. `-t csv,duckdb`; DuckDB output is a self-contained `.duckdb` database with a `timeline` table whose columns are the output-profile fields. (Breaking: the numeric `-t 1..5` form is replaced by names; `aws-ct-search` shares the option and gains the same named formats.) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Added a `Tags` column to the `aws-ct-timeline` and `azure-timeline` output that renders a rule's Sigma `tags` list as a single ` ¦ `-separated string (like Hayabusa) instead of dropping the list. ATT&CK tactics are abbreviated using the editable `config/mitre_tactics.txt` table shared with Hayabusa (e.g. `attack.credential-access` becomes `CredAccess`), while techniques and groups are shortened (`attack.t1562.001` becomes `T1562.001`, `attack.g0035` becomes `G0035`); both the hyphen and underscore tactic spellings are handled. JSON output keeps the value as a flat string. (#62) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Added a `-l, --localtime` option to the `aws-ct-timeline` and `azure-timeline` commands that outputs event timestamps in the machine's local timezone with an explicit UTC offset (e.g. `2023-07-10 12:27:45` becomes `2023-07-10 21:27:45+09:00` in JST) instead of UTC. Unparseable timestamps fall back to the existing UTC rendering. (#34) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Bumped `sigma-rust` to the released `v0.7.1` and updated all other dependencies to their latest versions. `sigma-rust` v0.7.1 keeps the Sigma correlation support suzaku relies on while moving its YAML backend off the deprecated `serde_yml`/`noyalib` (which parsed large unsigned 64-bit values in rules/events as lossy floats) to the actively maintained `yaml_serde`, restoring correct `u64` parsing. (@YamatoSecurity)
- Code refactored for easier handling of different log sources. (@fukusuket)
- Added support for Microsoft Graph API JSON format for Azure logs. (#113) (@fukusuket)
- `azure-timeline` now unwraps the `{ "records": [...] }` batch envelope used by Azure Monitor diagnostic-settings blobs and Event Hub messages (both whole-file and per-line), so those exports are read record-by-record instead of as a single event, and it now loads/matches the `identity_protection` (`riskdetection`) and `privileged_identity_management` (`pim`) rule types, which were previously dropped at load. (#130) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `azure-timeline` now loads and matches SigmaHQ's Microsoft 365 rules, which declare `logsource.service` as `audit`/`exchange`/`threat_detection`/`threat_management` — only `m365` was recognized before, so every upstream m365 rule was dropped at load. These services are routed through the same `Workload`/`RecordType` Unified Audit Log discriminator. (#137) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Added support for the M365 Unified Audit Log to `azure-timeline`: reads `Search-UnifiedAuditLog` CSV exports (and JSON) by unwrapping the `AuditData` column/wrapper, folds UAL Name/Value property bags (`ExtendedProperties`/`Parameters`/…) into objects so rules can match nested values (e.g. `ExtendedProperties.UserAgent`), parses single/pretty-printed record objects, no longer drops events when no time filter is set, parses the `CreationTime` timestamp, and adds an `m365` log-source service. The Azure output profile now surfaces DFIR-relevant M365 fields (`Workload`, `Operation`, `Result`, `User`, `SrcIP`, `TargetObject`, `UserAgent`, `AppId`, `LogonError`, and a `Details` summary of the change's `Parameters`/`ModifiedProperties`) instead of the previously empty Azure-Monitor-only columns. (#129) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Added `--file-date-from/--file-date-to` options that filter objects by their S3 key date prefix, distinct from the existing `--timeline-start/--timeline-end` options, which operates on in-file event timestamps. (#118) (@fukusuket)
- Added `-output-type` option for the `aws-ct-summary` command to output in JSON. (#123) (@fukusuket)

**Bug Fixes:**

- The `Results Summary` "Data reduction" line panicked (`attempt to subtract with overflow`) in debug builds — or printed a nonsensical ~1.8×10¹⁹ count in release, or `NaN%` on empty input — because `event_with_hits` (which correlation results increment for events already counted by the base scan) could exceed `total_events`. The count now saturates and the percentage is guarded against an empty dataset. (#163) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `aws-ct-summary` reported the wrong per-entry time range: the `first_seen`/`last_seen` of every summarized region, source IP, access key, user agent, and API were seeded once from the dataset-global min/max at the moment the key was first inserted and never updated, so they showed the whole dataset's span rather than that entry's own first/last occurrence. Each entry now tracks the first/last event time of the events that actually hit it. (#160) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Scanning now warns (`[WARNING] Skipping <file>: <reason>`) when it skips an input file it could not read — permission denied, non-UTF-8 content, a file removed mid-scan, or a corrupt/oversized `.gz` — instead of silently dropping it. Previously such a file was counted in the total but skipped with no indication, so the reported coverage was overstated. Applies to both the directory scan and single-file input, and the gzip size-cap warning was moved to this single call-site path. (#161) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `aws-ct-search` no longer panics on an invalid `--regex` value (it was compiled with `.expect()`); an invalid pattern now prints a clear error and exits cleanly. A malformed `--filter` missing the `FIELD:VALUE` colon — previously silently ignored — is now rejected up front. And `aws-ct-summary`'s warning when the abused-AWS-API list can't be opened now names the path it looked for and states that all API calls will be classified as non-abused. (#162) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `--geo-ip` enrichment (`SrcASN`/`SrcCity`/`SrcCountry`) was a silent no-op for `azure-timeline`/M365 logs: the source IP was resolved from a hardcoded `sourceIPAddress` field, which only exists in AWS CloudTrail. The Azure/M365 profile maps `SrcIP` to `callerIpAddress`/`ClientIP`/etc., so those columns always rendered `-` even for events with a routable public IP. The lookup now resolves the source IP from the profile's `SrcIP` field spec (the same `|`-separated fallback used for other columns), so Azure/M365 enrich just like AWS. (#159) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Malformed `--timeline-start` / `--timeline-end` / `--time-offset` values are now rejected up front with a clear error, instead of being parsed per-event and silently dropping **every** event (empty timeline, no warning) — e.g. a plain `--timeline-start 2024-01-01` instead of full RFC 3339. Also fixed a `parse_offset` panic on an empty offset, trailing whitespace, or a multibyte trailing character (the split index was taken from the untrimmed length). (#150) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Fixed a panic (`byte index 24 is not a char boundary`) when the end-of-scan "Rule Authors" summary truncated an author name longer than 27 bytes whose 24th byte fell mid-codepoint — routine for Japanese/CJK and other non-ASCII author names common in Sigma rule packs. Truncation now counts and cuts by characters, not bytes, so the completed run's output is no longer discarded. (#148) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Neutralized CSV/spreadsheet formula injection (CWE-1236) in report output. CSV cells come from attacker-influenceable cloud-log fields (`userAgent`, principal ARNs, error strings, …); a value beginning with `=`, `+`, `-`, `@`, tab, or CR would be evaluated as a formula when the report is opened in Excel/LibreOffice/Sheets. Such values are now prefixed with an apostrophe (spreadsheets treat it as a force-text marker) at all CSV sinks; JSON/JSONL and stdout are unchanged. (#146) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Bounded gzip decompression to stop a decompression-bomb OOM: a crafted or corrupt `.gz` file anywhere in the scanned tree could inflate to many GB (DEFLATE reaches ~1032:1) and get the entire scan OOM-killed. `.gz` inputs are now capped at 3 GiB decompressed, and an over-limit file is skipped with a warning instead of aborting the run. (#147) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `--geo-ip` corrupted the timeline output: when a record's `sourceIPAddress` was not a parseable IP address (routine for AWS-service events such as `cloudtrail.amazonaws.com`), the GeoIP lookup returned that raw string for *every* output column, overwriting `Timestamp`, `EventName`, `RuleTitle`, etc. Enrichment is now scoped to the `SrcASN`/`SrcCity`/`SrcCountry` columns only, which fall back to `-` when the address cannot be resolved. (#145) (@YamatoSecurity)
- Hardened the input/filesystem edge cases that previously aborted a scan with a Rust panic and backtrace: a non-UTF-8 filename anywhere in the scanned tree (which killed the initial file count before any results), an unreadable subdirectory or a file removed mid-scan, and an unwritable `--output` path now produce a clean, actionable error instead — the walk errors are reported and the output error exits non-zero with a `Cannot write to output file …` message. Applies across `aws-ct-timeline`, `azure-timeline`, `aws-ct-search`, `aws-ct-metrics`, and `aws-ct-summary`. Non-UTF-8 filenames are now read (the real path is kept through the scan pipeline) instead of being counted but skipped, and `aws-ct-summary`'s JSON/JSONL output also reports an unwritable `--output` path cleanly. (#149) (@YamatoSecurity)
- The `aws-ct-timeline`, `aws-ct-metrics`, `aws-ct-search`, and `aws-ct-summary` commands silently dropped JSONL input (one CloudTrail event, or a `{ "Records": [...] }` batch, per line): the parsers read the whole file as a single JSON document and returned no events when that failed. They now fall back to per-line JSONL parsing, and `.jsonl` files are discovered and read. (#139) (@YamatoSecurity)
- `-T, --no-frequency-timeline` option was not working so we removed it. Also fixed a logic bug in the authors display. (#110) (@fukusuket)
- Output file would get saved even if there were no results. (#114) (@fukusuket)
- `aws-ct-summary` would panic when processing a corrupt or imcomplete log file. (#119) (@fukusuket)
- `--geo-ip` would panic at startup (`invalid IP address syntax`) because the abbreviated CIDR strings used for the private-IP check (e.g. `10/8`, `172.16/12`, `2000::/3`) are no longer accepted by the `cidr` crate. Dropped the `cidr-utils` dependency and check private ranges directly with `std`'s `Ipv4Addr::is_private()` and a manual IPv6 prefix match; also populated the previously unused GeoIP country/city caches. (#132) (@fukusuket)
